                              I'm just a simple guy who just is looking for something new in life.  Web design and coding is the 
                              first step in a marathon of my life and I hope to do my very best in what I do.
                              <br>
                              I grew up on the island of Maui, Hawaii and lived there most of my life surrounded by Aloha spirit,
                              family, and loved ones.  I've always strived to put family and friends first, to think of others before
                              myself, and to bring the spirit of Aloha to whoever I meet.  I've dabbled in many industries in the past,
                              travel, customer service, retail, as well as construction, so but Information Technology is something I've
                              always been facinated by.  Computers and technology has always come easy to me when learning, and learning
                              web development and coding has been a joy!  Seeing a peek into the windows of the innerworkings of many things
                              that people use on a daily basis has been an eye opener!
                              <br>
                              Some of my hobbies outside of this include tabletop roleplaying games (Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Call of
                              Cuthulu), writing, as well as playing video games!  My favorite movie genre is horror, and I currently have a 
                              lovely wife and three fluffy kitty cats!
